# Siamese_in_progress
Siamese networks that almost work

The Files are as follows:

- `LFW_setup.ipynb`: run this to set up the LFW dataset for training. Originally this was stored in a folder labeled `lfw`, which also contained the downloaded LFW dataset.
- `APD_setup.ipynb`: run this to set up the APD dataset, if you have access to it. Note: originally the APD dataset was stored in a folder labeled `./data`, and the notebook `APD_setup.ipynb` was run in the directory containing the folder `./data` (i.e., one directory above the dataset APD)
- `siamese_LFW.ipynb`: run this in the directory above `./data` or `./lfw` to train a siamese network that doesn't yet work. I'm still unsure why.

Further descriptions are in the jupyter notebooks.
